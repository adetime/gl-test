Testing OpenGL on Exponent!

Change the component instantiated in `App` in `index.js` to try different
scenes. The scenes are:

- BasicScene: A very basic direct WebGL code example
- BasicTextureScene: Direct WebGL code that loads a texture

- MultiBasicScene: Many `GLView`s at once

- REGL*: Based on the examples at http://regl.party/examples

- THREE*: Based on the examples at https://threejs.org/examples/

- Conformance: Testing conformance against Khronos' conformance tests
